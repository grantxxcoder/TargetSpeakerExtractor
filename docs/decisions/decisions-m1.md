# Decision Log — M1 (BSRNN implementation)

Decisions taken from M1 onward. Earlier milestones are in `decisions-m0.md`,
which is closed. Open questions still live in `decisions-pending.md`.

M1 scope: causal BSRNN + TF-Map extractor implemented, training infrastructure
trustworthy. See `milestones.md`.

## 2026-08-18 — Training chunk length: 4 s

**Decision: `chunk_s = 4.0` (64,000 samples at 16 kHz).**

What the literature uses, all verified in the source PDFs/configs:

| Source | Task | Chunk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Luo & Yu, TASLP 2023 (music BSRNN) | Music separation | 3 s (T), drawn from 6 s salient segments |
| Yu et al., Interspeech 2023 (high-fidelity BSRNN) | Fullband SE + PSE | 6 s |
| Zhang et al., ICASSP 2025 (TF-Map) | TSE | 3 s |
| wesep `tse_bsrnn_spk.yaml` (REAL-TSE baseline) | TSE | 3 s (`chunk_len: 48000`) |
| CARTSE Track 1 (challenge winner) | **Online** TSE | **4 s** mixture, 3 s enrolment |

Why 4 s rather than the 3 s consensus:

1. **CARTSE is the only online, causal, TSE system in the set** — our exact task,
   and the system that won the track. It is the most defensible anchor we have.
   The 6 s outlier is a speech *enhancement* paper with no enrolment and no
   target-absent case, so its constraint is not ours.
2. **It reduces the empty-crop rate.** `target_activity_ratio` reaches down to
   0.15, so on an ~18 s clip a 3 s window can land entirely in target silence and
   silently turn a `both` trial into an absent example. A longer window catches
   speech more often. This mitigates the problem; it does not solve it — see the
   measurement required below.
3. **Our model is causal with an LSTM.** At inference the recurrent state persists
   across the whole stream, so training on short chunks means the state never
   accumulates as much context as it will see in deployment. Longer chunks narrow
   that train/inference gap. This argument does not apply to the offline models
   above, which is part of why they could afford 3 s.

Cost: ~33 % more frames per example than 3 s, so proportionally less batch at
equal memory.

**Required measurement before this is settled:** sample a few thousand crops from
`train` at 4 s and count how often `crop_absent` is true on rows where
`condition == "both"`. That is the empty-crop rate on *our* data rather than
argued from someone else's. If it is high, the fix is VAD-aware cropping, not a
longer chunk.

Enrolment length is unchanged at 5 s (`decisions-m0.md` 2026-08-12). CARTSE used
3 s; ours sits inside the 5–10 s range of Yu et al. No change proposed.

## 2026-08-18 — Batch size: 12

**Decision: `batch_size = 12`, provisional on GPU memory.**

Matches CARTSE at the same 4 s chunk length ("trained on 4 s chunks with batch
size 12 for 200 epochs"), so the chunk/batch pair is taken as a unit from a system
that trained successfully on this task rather than tuned independently.

Provisional because batch size is hardware-bound and M2 runs on Kaggle sessions,
not the machine this was chosen on. If it must change, record the new value and
the memory limit that forced it — the effective batch is a training-dynamics
parameter, not just a throughput knob, and a silent change makes M2's curves
incomparable to this baseline.
